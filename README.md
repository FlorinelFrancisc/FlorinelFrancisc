## Internship Experience

**Internship Trainee, Qlucore AB**  
*Oct 2024 – Dec 2024 (3 months)*  
*Lund, Skåne County, Sweden – On-site*

During my 12-week internship, my primary task was to split a large Git mono-repository containing all of Qlucore’s cloud-related assets into seven smaller repositories—one for each stack. This process preserved the file history, even though most files were relocated within the folder structure. Additionally, I implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for each repository, ensuring each stack could be deployed to both test and production environments.

After completing this repository restructuring and automation, I initiated a new open-source project, developing a required component for Qlucore. This component enables Qlucore’s customers to run batch jobs with biometric computations on AWS. This project is currently in development and will continue as my thesis project at Jensen after the internship.
